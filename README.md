# laravel-factory-bug

## Description
This repo is used to determine whether the factory error is indeed a bug.

To test it:
1. Clone repo
2. Run `composer install`
3. Run `vendor/bin/phpunit`
4. Watch explosions (or turn away, like they do in the movies)

##License
The Unlicense

A lot of code is boilerplate from running `laravel new`
